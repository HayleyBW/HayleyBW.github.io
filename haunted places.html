			<h2>Old Alton Bridge in Texas, United States (Goatmans Bridge)</h2>
			<p>There are many evil demons and ghosts that haunt this bridge but let's start off with one of the most friendly, nice ghosts who haunts the bridge who has a very sad back story. In 1930 there was an African American goat farmer named Oscar Washbrun who was a very nice well known man and liked by many people. He was called by people the goatman because he would always be herding goats around and there was even a sign on the bridge that said this way to the goatman's house. But what happened to him was truly sad, as he was crossing over the bridge he as jumped by Ku Klux Klan also known as the KKK which was an very racist group of people and what they did to Oscar was the tied a noose around his neck and hang him over the bridge and left him there and when they went back to fetch is dead body to get rid of it, when they went back to get, his body was no longer there all that was left there was an empty noose and what they thought he went to his home and burn his home down and ended by killing the whole Washburn family. And now Oscar haunts the bridge but even knowing what happened to him, he is a very nice friendly ghost who haunts the bridge. On the bridge there is a demon known as the Goatman who is half man and half goat with glowing red eyes, black fur. The Goatman is what the bridge is named after. When people have been on the bridge they have heard hooves grappling on the bridge behind them then hear and growling and with a voice telling them to get off the bridge. A couple things that have happen while people have been on the bridge is people being attacked by the Goatman and something that happens once on the bridge there was a person who went to the bridge with an friend, when there were there they heard a growling voice and when one of the friends run away and the other was left alone on the bridge was then dragged by the Goatman to the edge of the bridge and then thrown off the bridge into the river. What people have said is never knock three times on the bridge because the Goatman will come but not for an good reason.You may think that the Goatman is the most evil thing that is on the bridge but the most evil things that is on the bridge is and ghost who is very evil whose name is Steve who was one of the many leaders of the Ku Klux Klan, (KKK) he even did horrible things to his wife. His wife had enough with him that she ended up killing herself by drinking some prostin but when people were looking into her death they said that died from not only prostin but from cannibalism with bite marks all over because when Steve found her he ended up ripping her apart, biting and eating her lifeless body. When females are at goatman bridge they end up getting scratched and bitten by Steve. Around the bridge there is a tree that is very well known and people always say to people to never touch the tree or go throw it and because it is very demonic and is known as a portal. One thing that has happened was when I boy did not listen to the warning not to touch the tree he ended up touching it and then later on his way home from the place he ended up in a crash and ended up dying. Around the tree and the bridge there have been many satanic and sacrificial rituals that have happened around the tree, the bridge and in the forest and even on the other side of the bridge and big human ouija board.</p>
