			<h2>The Hooded Man</h2>
			<p>The Hooded Man game is very similar to the elevator game with how it can take you to another world. The only thing is the rules and what you have to do is very different to the elevator game. What you have to do is a cleansing ritual prior to starting the game like burning sage and spreading salt on your front door. When it is night time you have to go to a room in your house that has a telephone and what you want to do is call for a cab and if it has worked you will see an black parked cab outside your house. What you want to do now is exit your house and go to the cab and climb into it and sit in the back of the cab and lock the door behind you and go to sleep. If you wake up and look at your watch and it says exactly 3:30am you will then end up feeling yourself falling asleep again. Then when you wake up you will notice that you are on an unfamiliar road and if you look at the diver you will now notice that the diver is the hooded man. So people have said when they have played the game that there have been other people who have had people come into the cab and sit next to them. And if anyone comes into the taxi and sits next to you, you should never talk to them or pay any attention to them at all. If you want to end the ride all you have to do is lean over toward the hood man and whisper in his ear and say "I have reached my destination". You will then fall asleep and wake up in your house and then you have to straight away have to go to the telephone you used and dial a number and say "Thank you for the ride". You are then going to have to do another cleansing ritual afterwards. If you are in the cab you can ride in it for a long time if you want but as it goes on it gets more and more absurd as the ride goes on. And many people have said not that you should not go longer in the cab because you may also end up not being able to leave and you won't be able to escape that world anymore and you will be stuck there forever.</p>

How it works is you have to give it your location and you have to write in a word that is something you want to look for and after you have written in your word it says you have to think really hard on what you want to see. It will then show you some different locations around you that you can go to. People have had many different good and bad things happen when using this app. It can be very dangerous playing this app and what you should do is if you ever want to go to any of the locations this app says to make such that you go with a couple of people and never go alone. When some people have played this app have end up in bad way such as there was an incident that happened that ended up on the news, pretty much around the world about a group of teens who went randonauticaing  were they put the word travel into the app and it took them to a beach right to where they found in a suitcase. The teens think it could be something really cool in it like money. One of them went down to open it and once they opened it there was an disgusting odour coming from it and which had big black rubbish bags full of something in them, they then called the police and what was found in the suitcase was human remains that belonged to two different people. On this app you can write any work you want into it but you will never really know about what could be at the place it takes you to or who can end up waiting at the place.
