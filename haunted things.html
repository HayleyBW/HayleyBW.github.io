She and her roommate at first nurtured and accepted the doll but were frightened by the doll's malicious behaviour later on. They then ended up contacting the Warrens who ended up taking the doll and calling it demonically possessed. And what they did was they built a special glass case for the doll to reside in. There is warings all over the case and if you ever visit the museum you would be told not to mock, taunt and tease the doll and not to touch the glass case.

			<h2>Chair Of Death (Dead Man's Chair) (The Busby’s Stoop Chair)</h2>
			<p> The chair of death is known by 3 names which are dead man’s chair, the busby’s stoop chair and the chair of death which it is mostly called. Their chair of death was the favourite chair of an striper named Thomas Busby who in 1701 was convicted of murdering his father in law Auty and the reason he murdered him was because the Auty sat on his favourite chair during an argument about Tomas Busby’s wife Elizabeth Auty’s daughter. On Thomas Busby’s way to the gallows he asked if he could stop by the pub and when he was there he put a curse on the chair and the curse was, whoever sits on the chair will end up being haunted and will soon die. The chair stayed in the pub for centuries and people would be dared or would just sit on it and then later would die. During the world war 2 airmen from a nearby base would go into the pub and it ended up being a hot stop. At the pub people notice that anyone who sat in the chair before going to war would never come back and they would end up dead. Some cases of deaths from that chair two royal air force pilots sat on the chair and later while driving back they crashed into a tree and died. A few years later two bricklayers wanted to see if the chair’s curse was real so one of them sat on the chair and later that day the one who sat on the chair died by falling to his death. A roofer sat in the chair and then later died after he was on a roof working and collapsed. A cleaning lady stumbled into the chair while she was cleaning and later was killed by a brain tumour. Over time the owner put the chair in the basement of the pub and you would think that would end up being the end of it but it doesn't stop there. A delivery man who was in the basement sat in the chair and only an hour later died by crashing his truck. And other than death the owner gave the chair to a local museum and who ended up hanging it around about 5 feet from the ground to stop people from sitting but that did not stop the curse of the chair.</p>
